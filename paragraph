A portfolio website is a personal online space where you can showcase your skills, projects, and experiences in a professional way. 
It acts like a digital résumé, but more interactive and creative. Through different sections such as About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact, 
it helps visitors quickly understand who you are, what you can do, and how to reach you. A good portfolio website not only highlights your 
technical abilities and achievements but also reflects your personality and design style, making it an important tool for students, 
freelancers, and professionals looking to stand out
